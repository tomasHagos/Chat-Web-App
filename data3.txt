MaxVerstappen:Question 1)  The includes relationship is one-to-many because a species can encompass multiple breeds but a breed can only be associated with one species. Breed is a weak entity because it depends on the Species entity for its unique identification since a breed name is not unique across all species. Species have partial participation in this relationship because not all species have breeds. Breeds have total participation in this relationship because every breed is associated with a species.   The belongs to relationship is one-to-many because a breed can encompass multiple pets, but a pet can only be associated with one breed. Breeds have partial participation in this relationship because not all breeds in the agency are available for adoption. Since the agency maintains a list of breeds they can support, they may not have a specific breed at a given time. Pets have total participation in this relationship as each pet but be associated with a breed. Additionally, since each pet is associated with a specific breed, pets determine their breed.  The get along relationship is many-to-many because a pet can get along with multiple other pets. In addition, it is a partial participation because it is possible that a given pet doesn’t get along with any other pet.   Assumption: If a family is recorded in the agency database, it implies that they have either fostered, adopted, or both. So the only way to make this work is if we break up the families into adopting and fostering family entities. Since, if we had a single family entity the total participation with the fostered relationship and adopted relationship indicates that they did both which isn’t always true. If we remove these total participation then we are assuming that a family can exist in the database without fostering or adopting which doesn’t make sense.   Assumption: I made phone number and email address a multivalued attribute for the families since a family could have multiple email addresses and phone numbers in the database.   The fostered relationship is many-to-many because pets can be fostered by multiple families and families can foster many pets. Pets have partial participation in this relationship because it's possible that a pet may not be fostered by any family. Fostering families have total participation in this relationship because if a fostering family is in the agency database then they must have fostered at least one pet. The adopted relationship is many-to-one because pets can only be adopted by one family but a family can adopt multiple pets. Pets have partial participation in this relationship because it’s possible for a pet to never be adopted. Adopting families have total participation in this relationship because if they are in the agency database then they must have at least adopted one pet.        Question 2)  The bought relationship is many-to-many because each product can be bought by many students and students can buy multiple products. Products have partial participation in this relationship as a specific product may not be purchased by a student. Students have total participation in this relationship because if they are in the store’s database then they must have bought at least 1 product.  The use relationship is many-to-many because a textbook can be used in multiple courses, and a course can use multiple textbooks. Textbooks have partial participation in this relationship because there might be some textbooks in the store that aren’t used in any of the courses. Courses have partial participation in this relationship because there are some courses that don’t use any textbooks.   The offer relationship is 1-to-many because courses can have multiple sections but a section can only be from one course. Courses have partial participation in this relationship because some courses may not have a section offered for a specific term. That is, a course can exist in the database with no sections offered. Sections have total participation in this relationship because a section must be associated with a course. In addition, given a section we can determine a course.   The register relationship is many-to-many because a student can enroll in multiple sections across different courses while a specific section can have multiple students. Student’s have total participation in this relationship because to be labeled as a student, a person must be registered in at least one course which implies that a student must be registered in at least one section. Sections have partial participation in this relationship because not every section has students enrolled in it.  A section can exist in a database without any students enrolled in it. For instance, a newly created section.
